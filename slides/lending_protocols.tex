\begin{frame}{Introduction}
Besides exchanging assets, \textbf{borrowing} and \textbf{lending} are the most fundamental needs in a financial system. \\

Two distinct types of DeFi loans:
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Collaterallized loans} of undefined duration.
  \item \textbf{Flash loans} that are borrowed and repaid in one transaction. 
\end{enumerate} 
}

\uncover<3-> {
\vspace{1em}
Currently, we can distinguish two main lending protocol archetypes in DeFi: \textbf{Collateral Debt Protocols} and \textbf{Collateral Debt Markets}.

\begin{keytakeaway}{Unsecured Loans}
	Unsecured loans that can be used outside of a single transaction context require reliable identities.

\textbf{Position}: Entirety of an address' collateral $c$ and debt $d$ with a given lending protocol.
			
\vspace{1.0em}
			
\uncover<2-> {
\textbf{Loan-to-Value} (\textit{LTV}): Percentage at which the value of a collateral asset $i$ counts towards borrowing capacity. $LTV_i \in [0,1]$
}

\vspace{1.0em}

\uncover<3->{ 
\textbf{Borrowing capacity} ($BC$): Sum of $LTV$ adjusted values of all collateral types in a given position. Determines the maximum value that can be borrowed for the respective position.

\begin{equation*}
	BC = \sum c_i\, LTV_i 
	\label{eq:BC} 
\end{equation*}

$\Rightarrow$ A position can only take up new debt as long as its existing  debt across all assets is below borrowing capacity, i.e., $\sum d_i < BC$.

\begin{frame}{Some Terminology Around Lending in DeFi}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Liquidation Threshold} (LT): Threshold of debt relative to collateral at which a position becomes unhealthy and thus can be liquidated. $LT_i \in [0,1]$ and $LT_i \geq LTV_i$.

	\begin{equation*}
	  		LT =  \frac{\sum c_i \, LT_i}{\sum c_i}
	  	\label{eq:LT} 
	\end{equation*}
	

\vspace{1.0em}
\uncover<2->{
\textbf{Health Factor} (HF): Relative value of collateral, adjusted by LT, to outstanding debt of a position.

\begin{equation*}
	  HF = \frac{\sum c_i \, LT_i}{\sum d_i} \label{eq:HF} 
\end{equation*}

\vspace{1.0em}
$\Rightarrow$ A position with $HF \geq 1$ it is considered \color{focus} \textit{healthy}\color{black}.

$\Rightarrow$ Collateral of \color{focus} \textit{unhealthy} \color{black} positions can be liquidated.

\begin{frame}{CDM: Interest as a Function of Utilization }

Interest owed by borrowers $r_b$ in CDMs is \textbf{commonly variable and depends on \textit{utilization}} $u_t$ of the asset, i.e., how much of the liquidity provided by lender's $L_t$ is currently borrowed $D_t$.

	Two interest slopes set incentives for borrowing when utilization is below optimal $u_{opt}$ and repayment if its above, threatening the lenders' ability to withdraw assets.

\begin{frame}{CDM: Borrower's Interest and Lender's Yield }

In a CDM applying two interest slopes for an asset defined by the tuple $(r_{min}, r_{opt}, r_{max}, u_{opt})$, current $r_b$ accrued by borrowers can be expressed as follows:


\begin{equation*}
	r_b = 
		\begin{cases}
		r_{min} + \dfrac{u_t}{u_{opt}}(r_{opt}-r_{min}), & \text{if } u_t \leq u_{opt} \vspace{1em}\\
		r_{opt} + \dfrac{u_t-u_{opt}}{1-u_{opt}}(r_{max}-r_{opt}), & \text{if } u_t > u_{opt}
		\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\vspace{1em}

\uncover<2-> {
Accounting for a reserve factor $RF \in [0,1]$ deducted as income for the protocol, the $r_b$ collected from borrowers and attributed to the lenders of the asset as yield $r_l$ equals to:

\begin{equation*}
	r_l = u_t r_b (1-RF) 
\end{equation*}
}

%%%
\begin{frame}{A Borrower's Perspective}

With the transfer of collateral assets, \textbf{a credit line is opened }against which assets can be borrowed along the protocol’s terms.

\vspace{0.8 em}
Within CDMs, the collateral commonly becomes part of the assets available for borrowing, i.e., \textbf{a borrower is also a lender.}

\uncover<2-> {
\vspace{0.8 em}
A borrower must continuously \textbf{monitor prices} of collateral and debt assets incl. interest accrued, to avoid their \textbf{position becoming unhealthy}.

\vspace{0.8 em}
If liquidated, a position is \textbf{commonly subject to some penalty} funding the incentivation of liquidators.
}

\uncover<3-> {
\vspace{0.8 em}
\begin{keytakeaway}{Limited Risk for Borrowers}
	Risk of the borrower is effectively limited to the difference between collateral locked and debt drawn, as there is very limited effective recourse to compel repayment of borrowed assets.

\begin{frame}{Liquidations: Two Approaches (cont.)}

With protocols unable to become active by themselves, they \textbf{rely on arbitrageurs} to spot and liquidate unhealthy positions.

\uncover<2->{
\vspace{1 em}
Two approaches offering liquidation incentives can be observed: 

\vspace{1 em}
\textbf{1. Discount Sale} (e.g. Aave or Compound)
\vspace{0.2em}
\begin{itemize}
\item Any unhealthy position’s collateral is offered at a discount from the current on-chain oracle price.
\item Liquidator repays (part of the) position’s debt in the respective debt asset and in return receives collateral assets at the discounted price for the repaid amount.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Pro:} Atomic transaction, fast.

\textbf{Con:} Requires high accuracy of on-chain oracle prices at all times.
}

\end{frame}
%%%	


%%%
\begin{frame}{Liquidations: Two Approaches }


\textbf{2. Collateral Auction}\\
\vspace{0.2em}
Collateral price discovery via auctions, avoiding fixed liquidator incentives. Example of a format employed by MakerDAO \cite{MakerDAO}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dutch auction with starting price defined by oracle module. 
\item Collateral price decreases over time. 
\item Liquidators can buy any still available proportion of the collateral at current price.
\item Closes, when all debt is covered. Resets, if price falls below a certain ratio to the starting price or a duration limit is reached.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Pro:} Potentially leaving borrowers with a better collateral price.\\
\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Con:} Heavily depending on auction format. Considerations must be given to duration, lower-bound for  prices, oracle role, and resilience during network congestions driving cost of timely transactions.

For a successful flash loan of $x$ with interest $\rho$  and / or a flat fee $\varphi$:

\end{enumerate}

\uncover<2->{

\begin{keytakeaway}{Failing Flash Loans}

\begin{frame}{Example of Arbitrage with Flash Loan}

With $x$ as the amount borrowed and sold at the high-price exchange and $x^\ast$ the amount bought back at the low-price exchange with the proceeds, the payoff $\Pi$ can be expressed as:
