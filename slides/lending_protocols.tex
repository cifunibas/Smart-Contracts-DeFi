\begin{frame}{Introduction}
Besides exchanging assets, \textbf{borrowing} and \textbf{lending} are the most fundamental needs in a financial system. \\

\vspace{1em}

\uncover<2-> {
Due to openness and pseudonymity, DeFi loans exist in two formats:
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Collaterallized loans} of undefined duration.
  \item \textbf{Flash loans} that are borrowed and repaid in one transaction. 
\end{enumerate} 
}

\uncover<3-> {
\vspace{1em}
Currently, we can distinguish two main lending protocol archetypes in DeFi: \textbf{Collateral Debt Protocols} and \textbf{Collateral Debt Markets}.

\textbf{Position}: Entirety of an address' collateral $c$ and debt $d$ with a protocol.
			
\vspace{1.0em}
			
\uncover<2-> {
\textbf{Loan-to-Value} (\textit{LTV}): Percentage at which the value of a collateral asset counts towards borrowing capacity. $LTV_i \in [0,1]$
}

\vspace{1.0em}

\uncover<3->{ 
\textbf{Borrowing capacity} (BC): Total amount a position may borrow, given the value of its collateral assets and their respective $LTV$.

\begin{equation*}
	BC = \sum c_i\, LTV_i 
	\label{eq:BC} 
\end{equation*}

$\Rightarrow$ A position can only take up new debt as long as its existing  debt across all assets is below borrowing capacity, i.e., $BC > \sum d_i$
}

\end{frame}

%%%
\begin{frame}{Some Terminology Around Lending in DeFi}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Liquidation Threshold} (LT): Threshold of debt relative to collateral at which a position becomes unhealthy and thus can be liquidated. $LT_i \in [0,1]$ and $LT_i \geq LTV_i$.

	\begin{equation*}
	  		LT =  \frac{\sum c_i \, LT_i}{\sum c_i}
	  	\label{eq:LT} 
	\end{equation*}
	

\vspace{1.0em}
\uncover<2->{
\textbf{Health Factor} (HF): Relative value of collateral, adjusted by LT, to outstanding debt of a position.

\begin{equation*}
	  HF = \frac{\sum c_i \, LT_i}{\sum d_i} \label{eq:HF} 
\end{equation*}

\vspace{1.0em}
$\Rightarrow$ A position with $HF \geq 1$ it is considered \color{focus} \textit{healthy} \color{black} .

$\Rightarrow$ Collateral of \color{focus} \textit{unhealthy} \color{black} positions is available for liquidation.

Commonly receives a \emph{liquidity token} for the assets provided, that:
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Represents a \textbf{transferable claim} for the assets,
  \item \textbf{accounts for interest} earned, and

\end{itemize}

\uncover<2-> {
\vspace{1.0em}
$\Rightarrow$ Interest earned is \textbf{not risk free}: Protocol malfunctions or tail events that block necessary liquidations may leave lenders with liquidity tokens, that can not or only partially be reimbursed. These situations may be temporary or permanent.

\begin{frame}{CDM: Utilization Depending Interest }

Interest owed by borrowers $r_b$ in CDMs is \textbf{commonly variable and depends on \textit{utilization}} $u_t$ of the asset, i.e., how much of the liquidity provided by lender's $L_t$ is currently borrowed $D_t$.

\vspace{1em}

\begin{frame}{CDM: Borrower's Interest and Lender's Yield }

In a CDM applying a dual interest slope for an asset defined by the tuple $(r_0, s_1, s_2, u_{opt})$, current $r_b$ accrued by borrowers can be expressed as follows:

\vspace{0.5em}

\begin{equation*}
	r_b = 
		\begin{cases}
		r_0 + \dfrac{u_t}{u_{opt}}s_1, & \text{if } u_t \leq u_{opt}\\
		r_0 + \dfrac{u_t}{u_{opt}}s_1 + \dfrac{u_t-u_{opt}}{1-u_{opt}}s_2, & \text{if } u_t > u_{opt}
		\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\vspace{2em}

\uncover<2-> {
Accounting for a reserve factor $RF \in [0,1]$ deducted as income for the protocol, the $r_b$ collected from borrowers and attributed to the lenders of the asset as yield $r_l$ equals to:

\begin{equation*}
	r_l = u_t r_b (1-RF) 
\end{equation*}
}

%%%
\begin{frame}{A Borrower's Perspective}

With the transfer of collateral assets, \textbf{a credit line is opened }against which assets can be borrowed along the protocol’s terms.

\vspace{1 em}
Within CDMs, the collateral becomes part of the assets available for borrowing, i.e., \textbf{a borrower is also a lender.}

\uncover<2-> {
\vspace{1 em}
A borrower must continuously \textbf{monitor prices} of collateral and debt assets incl. interest accrued, to avoid their \textbf{position becoming unhealthy}.

\vspace{1 em}
If liquidated, a position is \textbf{commonly subject to some penalty} funding the incentivation of liquidators.
}

\uncover<3-> {
\vspace{1 em}
\textbf{Risk of the borrower is effectively limited to the difference between collateral locked and debt drawn}, as there is very limited effective recourse to compel repayment of borrowed assets.

\begin{frame}{Overcollateralization and Liquidation}

Protocols require a \textbf{minimum overcollateralization} in the pseudoanonymous DeFi environment, i.e., $d \leq c \cdot LT$.

\begin{frame}{Liquidations: Two Approaches (cont.)}

With protocols unable to become active by themselves, they \textbf{rely on arbitrageurs} to spot and liquidate unhealthy positions.

\uncover<2->{
\vspace{1 em}
Two approaches offering liquidation incentives can be observed: 

\vspace{1 em}
\textbf{1. Discount Sale} (e.g. Aave or Compound)
\vspace{0.2em}
\begin{itemize}
\item Any unhealthy position’s collateral is offered at a discount from the current on-chain oracle price.
\item Liquidator repays (part of the) position’s debt in the respective debt asset and in return receives collateral assets at the discounted price for the repaid amount.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Pro:} Atomic transaction, fast.

\textbf{Con:} Requires high accuracy of on-chain oracle prices at all times.
}

%%%
\begin{frame}{Liquidations: Two Approaches }


\textbf{2. Tend \& Dent Auction} (e.g. MakerDAO) \cite{Gervais21DeFiLiquidations}
\vspace{0.2em}
\begin{itemize}
\item English auction of an unhealthy position’s collateral can be started by anyone submitting the first bid.
\item Ends when either the maximum auction length is reached or the grace period since the last valid bid.
\item In the \emph{tend phase}, bidders compete by offering to pay larger proportions of the outstanding debt in exchange for the collateral.
\item If there is a bid to pay the debt in full, the auction enters the \textit{dent phase}. Now bidders compete further by accepting a lower proportion of the collateral for repayment of the debt in full.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Pro: }Independent of on-chain oracles.

\textbf{Con: }Time-consuming, costly process for bidders (multiple transactions) and no minimum sale price.

	Flash loans are a \textbf{concept unique to DeFi}. They are the only loans in the ecosystem that \textbf{do not require collateral}.
\end{minipage}

\uncover<2-> {
\vspace{2em}
In a flash loan, the funds are borrowed, used, and repaid back \textbf{all in one transaction}.
}

\vspace{1em}

\uncover<3-> {
Instead of collateral, lenders rely on \textbf{transaction atomicity}: If principal plus fee is not paid back in the same transaction, all is reverted as if the funds were never granted.

%%%
\begin{frame}{Flash Loan Conditions}
For a successful flash loan of $x$ with interest $\rho$  and / or a flat fee $\varphi$:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The lending market must \textbf{have $x$ liquid available.}\\
	\begin{equation*}
		x \leq LP_{x}
	\end{equation*}
	(Unless borrowed from a CDP, where $x$ can be \textit{flash-minted})
	\item The whole principal plus all interest and fees ($ x(1+\rho) + \varphi$) must be \textbf{returned at the end of the transaction.}
\end{enumerate}

\uncover<2->{
\vspace{1em}
$\Rightarrow$ If conditions are not met, the flash loan transaction is still included in the blockchain but is considered failed, i.e., it does not lead to any state changes except for a nonce update and transaction fee $\epsilon$.

\begin{frame}{Example of Arbitrage with Flash Loan}

With $x$ as the amount borrowed and sold at the high-price exchange and $x^\ast$ the amount bought back at the low-price exchange with the proceeds, the payoff $\Pi$ can be expressed as:

\begin{equation*}
	\Pi = max (x^{\ast}-[x \,(1+\rho) + \varphi ],0) - \epsilon
\end{equation*}

\begin{frame}{Consequence of Flash Loans}

Flash loans \textbf{effectively remove capital} constraints for any activity that can be performed in one transaction.

\vspace{1em}

\uncover<2->{
\textbf{Common Use Cases}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Collateral swaps (original use case)
\item Arbitrage
\item Portfolio Refactoring
\item Price Manipulation and Wash Trading

\end{itemize}
